# csds234_final_project

This project implemented the PageRank algoirthm with dataset from Simon Fraser University British Columbia, Canada (http://netsg.cs.sfu.ca/youtubedata/). The main purpose is to understand how we form our knowledge network from the videos we are vewing. How does properties of the video itself affect the rank of the videos to the recommendation? And what are some assumptions does the order entail?
